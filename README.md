# Sensing & Measurements Project

This repository contains the work done for the **Sensing & Measurements** course at the **Sharif University of Technology**.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into two parts: Theory and Experiment

In the Theory part, we design and develop a biomechanical recording system aimed at analyzing forearm movement during weightlifting activities. The
system combines strain gauge sensors for force measurement at the gripping section of the weight and surface electromyography (sEMG) to capture muscle activity
in the triceps brachii.

In the Experiment part, we focuse on the preprocessing and analysis of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals for the classification of purposeful hand movements. The primary objective was to develop a reliable method for processing raw sEMG data and utilizing it for movement classification tasks. The models used to process the recorded data, are KNN and Random Forest.
